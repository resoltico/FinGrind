## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- Stable deterministic rejection codes for core posting and correction admission, including
  duplicate idempotency, missing or forbidden correction reason, missing correction target,
  duplicate reversal target, and reversal-shape mismatch.
- Additional Jazzer regression coverage for forbidden committed-audit request fields and the new
  correction rejection paths.

### Changed
- Split caller-supplied request provenance from committed audit metadata. Posting requests no
  longer accept `provenance.recordedAt` or `provenance.sourceChannel`; FinGrind stamps those
  fields at commit time.
- Moved correction linkage out of `JournalEntry` and onto posting commands and committed facts,
  then enforced core correction rules at the application boundary.
- Replaced the versioned bootstrap schema file with one canonical current SQLite schema and made
  preflight against a missing book side-effect free.
- Hardened the SQLite and runtime write boundaries around typed commit outcomes, posting-id lookup,
  and one-reversal-per-target enforcement.

### Fixed
- Aligned the Docker smoke request payload with the current hard-break request contract so the
  containerized release-surface check exercises real `post-entry` success instead of a stale
  caller shape.
- Container publication verification now accepts the formatted JSON emitted by the `version`
  command, preventing false release-workflow failures after the GHCR images themselves were
  already published correctly.
