Notable changes to this project are documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-10

### Changed
- Replaced the SQLite shell-out adapter with an in-process Java 26 FFM adapter that keeps one real
  SQLite handle per opened book store, uses prepared statements through the SQLite C API, and
  performs commit-time duplicate checks inside the SQLite transaction boundary.
- Pinned controlled FinGrind surfaces to a managed SQLite 3.53.0 runtime built from the vendored
  official amalgamation, and removed the remaining reliance on whatever host `libsqlite3` version
  happened to be installed on local or CI machines.
- Updated Docker, CI, release, developer, and user-facing surfaces so Gradle runs, GitHub
  workflows, and the container image all verify and report the managed SQLite 3.53.0 contract.

### Fixed
- Corrected Gradle `api` versus `implementation` declarations so modules that expose core/runtime
  types through their public API compile cleanly through transitive boundaries.
- Made the nested Jazzer build compile and inject the same managed SQLite 3.53.0 runtime used by
  the root Gradle build so local fuzzing and regression replay no longer drift onto an older host
  library.
- Refreshed SQLite integration tests to assert the native-backed session lifecycle, schema
  initialization behavior, and direct failure mapping instead of the deleted subprocess executor.
- Hardened the native SQLite bridge so schema application uses `sqlite3_exec`, ordinary duplicate
  outcomes are decided before insert inside `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, and bound text no longer relies on
  statement-memory lifetime conventions.
- Refined native SQLite failure shaping so canonical schema loading fails at runtime instead of
  class initialization, and script execution prefers SQLite's exec-owned error text when present.
- Added machine-readable SQLite runtime metadata for managed-versus-system loading, required
  minimum version, ready versus incompatible runtime state, and the loaded SQLite version.
- Tightened request-money parsing so exponent notation is rejected as `invalid-request` instead of
  leaking raw arithmetic overflow from extreme numeric inputs.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- Stable deterministic rejection codes for core posting and correction admission, including
  duplicate idempotency, missing or forbidden correction reason, missing correction target,
  duplicate reversal target, and reversal-shape mismatch.
- Additional Jazzer regression coverage for forbidden committed-audit request fields and the new
  correction rejection paths.

### Changed
- Split caller-supplied request provenance from committed audit metadata. Posting requests no
  longer accept `provenance.recordedAt` or `provenance.sourceChannel`; FinGrind stamps those
  fields at commit time.
- Moved correction linkage out of `JournalEntry` and onto posting commands and committed facts,
  then enforced core correction rules at the application boundary.
- Replaced the versioned bootstrap schema file with one canonical current SQLite schema and made
  preflight against a missing book side-effect free.
- Hardened the SQLite and runtime write boundaries around typed commit outcomes, posting-id lookup,
  and one-reversal-per-target enforcement.

### Fixed
- Aligned the Docker smoke request payload with the current hard-break request contract so the
  containerized release-surface check exercises real `post-entry` success instead of a stale
  caller shape.
- Container publication verification now accepts the formatted JSON emitted by the `version`
  command, preventing false release-workflow failures after the GHCR images themselves were
  already published correctly.
